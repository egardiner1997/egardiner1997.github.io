                        Fanfiction.net is an online fanfiction site where writers and readers can readers
                        can read and write alternate endings to the stories they have read. This site is also 
                        a place that I frequent when I don't want to read a normal book. I have a profile and prefer to use the 
                        mobile view rather than the browser view when I use the website.

                        The above image is an image of the mobile view. The mobile view allows you to simply click the options
                        that you want to have includeded in receiving notifications about fanfiction and messages sent from other writers or readers.
                        When you are searching for a story then you can click on the form at the bottom to quickly search through what
                        you want to see and its quicker than the browser view. 
                    </p>

                        The image on the right is an image of the mobile view. The mobile view allows you to simply click the options
                        that you want to have includeded in receiving notifications about fanfiction and messages sent from other writers or readers.
                        When you are searching for a story then you can click on the form at the bottom to quickly search through what
                        you want to see and its quicker than the browser view. In the browser view you need to click through a bunch of separate boxes to find what you are
                        looking for and while this is easy on a computer screen, it is really irritating on a mobile screen.
