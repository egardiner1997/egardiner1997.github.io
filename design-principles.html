                    <h2>Visual Hiearchy</h2>
                    <h3>Facebook.com</h3>
                    <h4><a href="https://www.facebook.com/">https://www.facebook.com/</h4></a>
                    <p>
                        Visual Hiearchy is where certain things are either different sizes, colors, or shapes
                        to draw the attention of your audience.
                        Facebook is an example of visual hiearchy because the timeline is the main focus
                        of the website. Then you have the icons on the top that are the next biggest thing on the page
                        to show that you should click them next explore. Some headlines on ads or posts are bigger than 
                        others because they want to draw your attention.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Repetition</h2>
                    <h3>Wells Fargo</h3>
                    <h4><a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/">https://www.wellsfargo.com/</h4></a>
                    <p>
                        Repetition is the repeating of certain fonts, colors, shapes, and placements.
                        In the case of web design it can also be related to link and the way they are set up.
                        Wells Fargo's online site has drop down boxes repeated at the top of the page 
                        and when you go down the page the links are also placed in similar places. They also
                        repeat a lot of the same color scheme and box shapes.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Proximity</h2>
                    <h3>Deviantart.com</h3>
                    <h4><a href="https://www.deviantart.com/">https://www.deviantart.com/</h4></a>
                    <p>
                        Deviantart is an example of proximity because they fill up spaces with images so that there
                        is very little blank space. They leave enough space to show the differences in size with 
                        the images, but they love to fit the boxes together to make sure there isn't any negative space.
                    </p>
